# Mobile Monitor
## Background
When an elderly famliy member falls down and they are unable to get back up the only way for them to get help is to use the Life Alert(R) system, or wait for someone to find them. What if they falldown in the middle of the night and don't want to bother others, or if they have an emergency that prevents them from pushing the button on the Life Alert pendent.

This robotics project hopes to tackle this problem by automatically monitoring a home for emergencies and alerting family members. Also act as a way of communication and interactivity with family members. The point is to not add anything to the structure of the house like cameras or sensors under the floor.
